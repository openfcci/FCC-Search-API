# FCC Search API
Documentation and resources for the Forum Communications Company (FCC) search API powered by Elasticsearch.

- [FCC Search API Proxy](https://fccpublicsearch.herokuapp.com/fccnn/_search)
- [Sift Search UI](http://fccsearch.herokuapp.com/search)

## Overview
This public search proxy is an experimental API that is being made available just for this hackathon. Please be respectful and donâ€™t abuse it.

## History
- The search API was developed as a replacement for Google Custom Search, and is currently live in production as the basic search functionality on all FCC online news properties.
- Sift, the React-based search UI was originally developed as a testing tool and proof-of-concept of headless front-end implementations, but will be expanded for internal use by journalists for research and data-mining purposes.
- In the future, this decoupled content index will allow us easy and fast client-agnostic data access for anything from headless front-end sites, progressive web apps, chatbots and more, in an easy and unified API.

## Quick Facts
- Real-time indexing of published articles on over 40 FCC news properties.
- The index and API are still currently under development and should be considered in the alpha phase.
- Documents in the index currently include news articles from 01/01/2015-present, but content will ultimately span back to 1999 and will expand to include additional document types such as obituaries, celebrations, legal notices and more.
- The 350+ sites on the AreaVoices network (which are currently on a separate index) will be migrated to the same cluster for centralized, cross-network search and data aggregation.
- Access to the index is achieved via a custom node.js proxy app which restricts public access to GET and POST requests only to help maintain data integrity during development.
